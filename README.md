# MR2combine

Monster Rancher 2 (PSX version) Breeding tools to find out:
- optimal parents for a specified breed
- optimal parent-B and optimal offpspring for a specified parent-A
- optimal monster Breed overall
- optimal training/raising using Monte Carlo approach for smooth stat distribution

## User Interface

Currently nonexistent with no plans to make any.  This tool is merely for personal use.  It is very functional, however.  

If you want to use it, you need to change the main function in Mr2Combine.java and run it.  Since most methods are private.  

It's not to be used as a library since it doesn't have any kind of abstraction yet.
